The user mentioned avoiding Mimic Fish to keep it simple, so I should probably not include index 11 unless necessary. Let's look at the roster again to pick the best combination.\\\\n\\\\nThe fish options are from 0 to 11. The key is to find synergies between their passives and active skills. Let's go through each fish's abilities:\\\\n\\\\nArcherfish (0): Passive triggers when a teammate is below 30% HP, dealing 30 damage to the attacker. Active attacks all enemies for 35% ATK. That's good area damage.\\\\n\\\\nPufferfish (1): Similar passive to Archerfish, but the active lets it deal 50 damage to a teammate to gain 70 ATK. That's a trade-off but could boost ATK for others.\\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel (2): Passive reduces damage taken and splits some among teammates, gaining ATK over time. Active is like Archerfish's, AoE 35%.\\\\n\\\\nSunfish (3): Like Electric Eel but the active is similar to Pufferfish. Hmm, maybe similar to Eel but different active.\\\\n\\\\nSea Wolf (4): 30% dodge, and active deals 120 critical damage. Good for single target attacks.\\\\n\\\\nManta Ray (5): 30% dodge passive, active gives damage reduction and ATK boost to a teammate. That's a support role.\\\\n\\\\nSea Turtle (6): Shields and dodge after, active heals and has a critical damage first 3 uses. The healing and shields are nice.\\\\n\\\\nOctopus (7): Heals after damage, active gives damage reduction and ATK. Similar to Manta but with healing.\\\\n\\\\nGreat White Shark (8): Active attacks lowest HP, 120% or 140% depending on target HP. Good for finishing enemies.\\\\n\\\\nHammerhead Shark (9): Passive heals and ATK boost when low, explodes on death. Active similar to Great White but with explosion.\\\\n\\\\nClownfish (10): Passive deals damage to attacker when low HP. Active gives damage sharing and has AoE first 3 times.\\\\n\\\\nMimic Fish (11): Copies another's abilities. Since the advice is to avoid it, skip for now.\\\\n\\\\nLooking for synergies. Maybe a mix of AoE and support. Let's see:\\\\n\\\\nOption 1: Archerfish (0), Electric Eel (2), Manta Ray (5), Great White Shark (8). \\\\n\\\\nArcher and Eel have AoE attacks which can help clear multiple enemies. Manta supports by giving damage reduction, and Great White can finish off low HP foes.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Sea Turtle (6) with its shields and healing might be good for survivability. Maybe replace one of the others with Turtle.\\\\n\\\\nWait, maybe Archerfish, Electric Eel, Manta Ray, and Sea Turtle. The Eel's passive helps distribute damage, Archer's AoE, Manta's support, and Turtle's shields. But then Great White's active could be useful for burst.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, let's see another combo. Maybe Sea Wolf (4) for the critical damage, Manta (5), Electric Eel (2), and Sea Turtle (6). \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, considering the passives, Electric Eel and Sunfish have similar passives but different actives. Maybe Eel is better with AoE.\\\\n\\\\nHmm, the user wants to avoid Mimic, so let's go with four straightforward fish with good synergy. Let's pick:\\\\n\\\\nArcherfish (0) for AoE, Electric Eel (2) for AoE and damage reduction, Manta Ray (5) for support, and Sea Turtle (6) for durability. \\\\n\\\\nSo indices 0,2,5,6. \\\\n\\\\nWait, but Sea Turtle's active gives a heal and critical damage on first three uses. That could be helpful. Manta's active gives damage reduction and ATK to a teammate, which is good support. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe include Great White Shark (8) instead of Turtle for more offensive punch. Let me think again.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Electric Eel (2) and Archerfish (0) can both hit multiple targets. Then add Manta (5) and Great White (8). That way, they can clear waves and finish enemies. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Sea Wolf (4) with critical damage could be better than Great White? But Great White has higher base damage percentage.\\\\n\\\\nHmm. Let's decide on the first option. Let's go with 0 (Archerfish), 2 (Electric Eel), 5 (Manta Ray), and 6 (Sea Turtle). That gives a balanced team with AoE, support, and survivability. \\\\n\\\\nWait, but the Manta's active can help protect the team. Maybe that's a solid choice. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Sea Turtle's shields might be better for the first round. \\\\n\\\\nI think that's a good combination. Let me check the indices again:\\\\n\\\\n0: Archerfish\\\\n\\\\n2: Electric Eel\\\\n\\\\n5: Manta Ray\\\\n\\\\n6: Sea Turtle\\\\n\\\\nNo Mimic, so no need for mimic_choice.

The user mentioned avoiding Mimic Fish to keep it simple, so I should probably not include index 11 unless necessary. Let's look at the roster again to pick the best combination.\\\\n\\\\nThe fish options are from 0 to 11. The key is to find synergies between their passives and active skills. Let's go through each fish's abilities:\\\\n\\\\nArcherfish (0): Passive triggers when a teammate is below 30% HP, dealing 30 damage to the attacker. Active attacks all enemies for 35% ATK. That's good area damage.\\\\n\\\\nPufferfish (1): Similar passive to Archerfish, but the active lets it deal 50 damage to a teammate to gain 70 ATK. That's a trade-off but could boost ATK for others.\\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel (2): Passive reduces damage taken and splits some among teammates, gaining ATK over time. Active is like Archerfish's, AoE 35%.\\\\n\\\\nSunfish (3): Like Electric Eel but the active is similar to Pufferfish. Hmm, maybe similar to Eel but different active.\\\\n\\\\nSea Wolf (4): 30% dodge, and active deals 120 critical damage. Good for single target attacks.\\\\n\\\\nManta Ray (5): 30% dodge passive, active gives damage reduction and ATK boost to a teammate. That's a support role.\\\\n\\\\nSea Turtle (6): Shields and dodge after, active heals and has a critical damage first 3 uses. The healing and shields are nice.\\\\n\\\\nOctopus (7): Heals after damage, active gives damage reduction and ATK. Similar to Manta but with healing.\\\\n\\\\nGreat White Shark (8): Active attacks lowest HP, 120% or 140% depending on target HP. Good for finishing enemies.\\\\n\\\\nHammerhead Shark (9): Passive heals and ATK boost when low, explodes on death. Active similar to Great White but with explosion.\\\\n\\\\nClownfish (10): Passive deals damage to attacker when low HP. Active gives damage sharing and has AoE first 3 times.\\\\n\\\\nMimic Fish (11): Copies another's abilities. Since the advice is to avoid it, skip for now.\\\\n\\\\nLooking for synergies. Maybe a mix of AoE and support. Let's see:\\\\n\\\\nOption 1: Archerfish (0), Electric Eel (2), Manta Ray (5), Great White Shark (8). \\\\n\\\\nArcher and Eel have AoE attacks which can help clear multiple enemies. Manta supports by giving damage reduction, and Great White can finish off low HP foes.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Sea Turtle (6) with its shields and healing might be good for survivability. Maybe replace one of the others with Turtle.\\\\n\\\\nWait, maybe Archerfish, Electric Eel, Manta Ray, and Sea Turtle. The Eel's passive helps distribute damage, Archer's AoE, Manta's support, and Turtle's shields. But then Great White's active could be useful for burst.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, let's see another combo. Maybe Sea Wolf (4) for the critical damage, Manta (5), Electric Eel (2), and Sea Turtle (6). \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, considering the passives, Electric Eel and Sunfish have similar passives but different actives. Maybe Eel is better with AoE.\\\\n\\\\nHmm, the user wants to avoid Mimic, so let's go with four straightforward fish with good synergy. Let's pick:\\\\n\\\\nArcherfish (0) for AoE, Electric Eel (2) for AoE and damage reduction, Manta Ray (5) for support, and Sea Turtle (6) for durability. \\\\n\\\\nSo indices 0,2,5,6. \\\\n\\\\nWait, but Sea Turtle's active gives a heal and critical damage on first three uses. That could be helpful. Manta's active gives damage reduction and ATK to a teammate, which is good support. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe include Great White Shark (8) instead of Turtle for more offensive punch. Let me think again.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Electric Eel (2) and Archerfish (0) can both hit multiple targets. Then add Manta (5) and Great White (8). That way, they can clear waves and finish enemies. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Sea Wolf (4) with critical damage could be better than Great White? But Great White has higher base damage percentage.\\\\n\\\\nHmm. Let's decide on the first option. Let's go with 0 (Archerfish), 2 (Electric Eel), 5 (Manta Ray), and 6 (Sea Turtle). That gives a balanced team with AoE, support, and survivability. \\\\n\\\\nWait, but the Manta's active can help protect the team. Maybe that's a solid choice. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Sea Turtle's shields might be better for the first round. \\\\n\\\\nI think that's a good combination. Let me check the indices again:\\\\n\\\\n0: Archerfish\\\\n\\\\n2: Electric Eel\\\\n\\\\n5: Manta Ray\\\\n\\\\n6: Sea Turtle\\\\n\\\\nNo Mimic, so no need for mimic_choice.

The user mentioned that in the previous attempt, there was no tool call made, so I need to make sure to use the select_team_tool correctly this time. Let me think through the options.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, looking at the roster provided, there are 12 fish. The key is to pick four with good synergies. The user recommended avoiding Mimic Fish for simplicity, so maybe I should avoid index 11 unless necessary. Let me check each fish's abilities again.\\\\n\\\\nArcherfish (0) has an active that attacks all enemies for 35% ATK. Pufferfish (1) can boost ATK by sacrificing HP. Electric Eel (2) and Sunfish (3) have similar passives but their active skills differ. Sunfish's active is similar to Pufferfish's, so maybe they aren't the best together. \\\\n\\\\nSea Wolf (4) has a critical attack active, Manta Ray (5) can give damage reduction and ATK boost. Sea Turtle (6) has shields and a healing active with critical damage on first uses. Octopus (7) also gives damage reduction. Great White Shark (8) and Hammerhead (9) have strong attacks based on target HP. Clownfish (10) can share damage and has an AoE active. \\\\n\\\\nI need a balanced team. Maybe a mix of defense, offense, and support. Let's consider:\\\\n\\\\n1. Archerfish (0) for area damage.\\\\n2. Sea Turtle (6) for shields and healing.\\\\n3. Great White Shark (8) for strong attacks on low HP targets.\\\\n4. Manta Ray (5) for damage reduction and ATK boost.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe Electric Eel (2) for sustained ATK gains? Or Octopus (7) for support. Let me see the synergy. Archerfish's AoE can help with clearing, Sea Turtle's shields protect, Great White can finish off low HP enemies, and Manta Ray's damage reduction and ATK boost can make attacks more effective. That seems solid. \\\\n\\\\nWait, the user said to avoid Mimic Fish unless needed, so I won't include index 11. Let me confirm the indices: 0 (Archerfish), 5 (Manta Ray), 6 (Sea Turtle), 8 (Great White Shark). That's four. Let me check if there's any overlap or better combos. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe replace Great White with Hammerhead for explosion when killed, but Great White's active is more consistent. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Clownfish (10) could share damage and have AoE. Hmm. But maybe the initial selection is okay. \\\\n\\\\nSo the team indices would be [0,5,6,8]. Let me make sure that's four distinct indices. Yes. And since there's no Mimic Fish, the mimic_choice is not needed. Therefore, the correct function call would be select_team_tool with fish_indices [0,5,6,8]. \\\\n\\\\nI need to format this properly as a JSON tool call within the XML tags. Let me ensure no typos. The parameters should be fish_indices as an array of integers, and since no Mimic is used, omit mimic_choice. The function is select_team_tool.\\\\n</think>\\\\n\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"response_metadata\\\": {\\n    \\\"model\\\": \\\"qwq:32b\\\",\\n    \\\"created_at\\\": \\\"2025-08-15T18:08:56.473570756Z\\\",\\n    \\\"done\\\": true,\\n    \\\"done_reason\\\": \\\"stop\\\",\\n    \\\"total_duration\\\": 26211520752,\\n    \\\"load_duration\\\": 48561574,\\n    \\\"prompt_eval_count\\\": 2128,\\n    \\\"prompt_eval_duration\\\": 2057079782,\\n    \\\"eval_count\\\": 712,\\n    \\\"eval_duration\\\": 24095904260,\\n    \\\"model_name\\\": \\\"qwq:32b\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"tool_calls\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"{'name': 'select_team_tool', 'args': {'fish_indices': [0, 5, 6, 8]}, 'id': 'cd8958f8-dba8-40b4-a999-3f31e989e3d0', 'type': 'tool_call'}\\\",\\n      \\\"args\\\": {},\\n      \\\"id\\\": null,\\n      \\\"raw\\\": \\\"{'name': 'select_team_tool', 'args': {'fish_indices': [0, 5, 6, 8]}, 'id': 'cd8958f8-dba8-40b4-a999-3f31e989e3d0', 'type': 'tool_call'}\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"raw_response_type\\\": \\\"<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>\\\",\\n  \\\"additional_attrs\\\": {\\n    \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": \\\"{}\\\",\\n    \\\"construct\\\": \\\"<bound method BaseModel.construct of <class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>>\\\",\\n    \\\"copy\\\": \\\"<bound method BaseModel.copy of AIMessage(content=\\\\\\\"<think>\\\\\\\\nOkay, I need to select a team of four fish for the Aquawar tournament.

Let me go through the roster again to see which ones have good synergies. \\\\n\\\\nFirst, looking at the fish types and their abilities. The goal is to pick a team that can either protect each other, deal damage efficiently, or have some combo effects. Let's see:\\\\n\\\\nArcherfish (0) has an active that attacks all enemies for 35% ATK. That's area damage, which can be useful. Its passive is similar to Pufferfish (1), dealing 30 damage to attackers when a teammate is below 30% HP. \\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel (2) has a passive that reduces damage taken by 70% and splits the rest among teammates. Plus, they gain 20 ATK for every 200 total damage taken. Their active is also an area attack like Archerfish. \\\\n\\\\nSunfish (3) has a similar passive to Electric Eel, but their active is like Pufferfish's, dealing 50 damage to a teammate for 70 ATK. Hmm, maybe not as good as the Electric Eel's ATK gain over time.\\\\n\\\\nSea Wolf (4) has a 30% dodge chance and an active that does 120 critical damage to one enemy. That's a strong single-target attack.\\\\n\\\\nManta Ray (5) has dodge and an active that gives a teammate 70% damage reduction and +20 ATK. That's a defensive support.\\\\n\\\\nSea Turtle (6) has shields and an active that gives healing (with some crit damage on first three uses). The healing could be helpful, but the crit part is only on first three uses.\\\\n\\\\nOctopus (7) has healing after damage and an active similar to Manta's, giving damage reduction and +ATK.\\\\n\\\\nGreat White Shark (8) has an active that attacks the lowest HP enemy with increased damage if they're below 40%. That's a good finisher.\\\\n\\\\nHammerhead Shark (9) is similar but has an explosion when killed. Maybe less reliable unless you plan to let it die.\\\\n\\\\nClownfish (10) has a passive that damages attackers when low HP and an active that shares damage and can attack all. The sharing might be useful for spreading damage.\\\\n\\\\nMimic Fish (11) is tricky since it copies another's abilities. But the user says to avoid it if possible to keep things simple.\\\\n\\\\nSo, avoiding Mimic Fish for simplicity. Let's look for a team with both offense and defense. \\\\n\\\\nMaybe Archerfish and Electric Eel for their area attacks and damage mitigation. Then, Manta Ray for support and defense. And Sea Wolf for the critical hits. \\\\n\\\\nWait, but Electric Eel's passive can stack ATK over time, which would make their area attacks better. Archerfish's active also helps with AoE. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, combining Sea Turtle for shields and healing, but maybe that's too defensive. \\\\n\\\\nAnother option: Great White Shark for strong attacks on weak enemies, combined with something else. \\\\n\\\\nHmm, let's see. Maybe:\\\\n\\\\n0 (Archerfish), 2 (Electric Eel), 4 (Sea Wolf), and 8 (Great White Shark). \\\\n\\\\nThat gives two area attacks (Archerfish and Electric Eel), a strong single target (Sea Wolf's critical), and Great White's attack on low HP. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, replacing Sea Wolf with Manta Ray to have better defense. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Electric Eel with their passive can take damage and boost ATK, which would make their AoE better over time. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Archerfish and Electric Eel for AoE, Manta for defense, and Great White for finishing enemies. \\\\n\\\\nWait, let me think again. The team needs synergy. \\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel's passive reduces damage taken, so they can survive longer, which helps the team. Their ATK gain from damage taken means their area attacks get stronger as the battle goes on. \\\\n\\\\nArcherfish can also AoE, so combining with Electric Eel's AoE might be good. \\\\n\\\\nFor support, maybe Manta Ray (5) to give damage reduction and ATK to a teammate. \\\\n\\\\nThen, maybe Sea Wolf (4) for the critical hit. \\\\n\\\\nSo indices 0,2,4,5. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, replacing Sea Wolf with Great White to have better damage on low HP enemies. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe Sea Turtle (6) with shields could be helpful. \\\\n\\\\nHmm, Sea Turtle's active gives healing and first three uses do critical damage. That might be useful for keeping the team alive. \\\\n\\\\nBut I'm trying to pick four without Mimic. Let's see:\\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel (2), Archerfish (0), Sea Wolf (4), and Sea Turtle (6). \\\\n\\\\nThis way, Electric Eel can tank and boost ATK, Archerfish does AoE, Sea Wolf for critical hits, and Sea Turtle can heal and shields. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe Manta Ray (5) instead of Sea Turtle. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Great White (8) instead of Sea Wolf. \\\\n\\\\nHmm, perhaps the best combination is Electric Eel (2) for passive defense and ATK gain, Archerfish (0) for AoE, Sea Wolf (4) for critical hits, and Manta Ray (5) to boost teammates. \\\\n\\\\nSo selecting indices [0,2,4,5]. \\\\n\\\\nWait, let me check if there's a better combination. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Electric Eel and Sunfish (3) both have the damage-splitting, but Sunfish's active is weaker. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, combining Archerfish and Clownfish (10) for their damage sharing. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe Electric Eel, Archerfish, Great White, and Manta Ray. \\\\n\\\\nHmm, but Great White's active is good for targeting the weakest enemy. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, the team [0,2,5,8] (Archerfish, Electric Eel, Manta Ray, Great White). That might be a solid team. \\\\n\\\\nLet me think of their roles:\\\\n\\\\n- Archerfish: AoE damage, helpful for clearing enemies when they're weak.\\\\n- Electric Eel: Tanks, increases ATK over time, AoE.\\\\n- Manta Ray: Can buff a teammate with damage reduction and ATK.\\\\n- Great White: Strong on low HP enemies, so if you can whittle someone down, they finish it. \\\\n\\\\nThat sounds good. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, replacing Manta with Sea Wolf (critical hit) but Manta's support is also valuable. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, using Octopus (7) instead of Manta, but they have similar abilities to Manta. \\\\n\\\\nHmm, maybe Manta is better because it's similar but with different active. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Sea Turtle for shields. \\\\n\\\\nBut maybe going with the first idea: [0 (Archerfish), 2 (Electric Eel), 5 (Manta Ray), 8 (Great White)]. \\\\n\\\\nWait, but the user's example used [0,3,7,11] with mimic. Since we're avoiding mimic, that's okay. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, I'll go with this combination. Let me check for synergy:\\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel's passive helps the team survive, and over time their ATK increases. Archerfish's AoE can hit all enemies, helpful when Electric Eel's ATK is higher. Manta can buff a frontline unit, and Great White can take out weakened enemies. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe Electric Eel and Archerfish's AoE can stack. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, is there a better option?\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, using the two AoE (Archerfish and Electric Eel), then adding Sea Wolf and Great White for single target damage. \\\\n\\\\nHmm, but Sea Wolf's critical hits are powerful. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, I'll go with Electric Eel, Archerfish, Manta Ray, and Great White. \\\\n\\\\nWait, but I should make sure that the indices are correct. \\\\n\\\\nThe indices are:\\\\n\\\\n0: Archerfish\\\\n\\\\n2: Electric Eel\\\\n\\\\n5: Manta Ray\\\\n\\\\n8: Great White Shark\\\\n\\\\nYes. \\\\n\\\\nSo, the team indices would be [0,2,5,8]. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe replacing Great White with Sea Wolf (4) for more early damage. \\\\n\\\\nHmm, but Great White's active is better for finishing low HP enemies. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Sea Wolf's critical is a flat 120 damage, which is strong. \\\\n\\\\nHmm, tough choice. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, let me think of another approach. \\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel and Archerfish have good AoE, so their combination is strong. \\\\n\\\\nManta Ray can help protect them. \\\\n\\\\nThen, maybe Octopus (7) instead of Great White. \\\\n\\\\nOctopus has healing after damage and can also give damage reduction. \\\\n\\\\nBut perhaps Great White is better for offense. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, I think the team [0,2,5,8] is a solid choice with a mix of AoE, support, and strong finishing moves. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe adding Sea Turtle (6) for shields. \\\\n\\\\nBut then the team would lose either Manta or Great White. \\\\n\\\\nHmm. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Electric Eel (2), Archerfish (0), Manta Ray (5), and Sea Turtle (6). \\\\n\\\\nSea Turtle's shields could help the team survive early on. \\\\n\\\\nTheir active can give healing and possibly crit damage. \\\\n\\\\nBut Great White might be better for offense. \\\\n\\\\nHmm, maybe the initial selection is better. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe the team of Electric Eel, Archerfish, Sea Wolf, and Manta Ray. \\\\n\\\\nSo [0,2,4,5]. \\\\n\\\\nSea Wolf's critical can hit hard, while Manta supports. \\\\n\\\\nThis might be a good mix. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, I need to pick the best four without mimic. \\\\n\\\\nAfter considering, I think going with [0,2,4,5] (Archerfish, Electric Eel, Sea Wolf, Manta Ray) provides a good balance of area damage, single target critical, and support. \\\\n\\\\nBut wait, Electric Eel's passive is great for survival and increasing ATK over time, which makes their AoE better. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, I might stick with that. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe replacing Sea Wolf with Great White to have a better late-game finisher. \\\\n\\\\nHmm. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, let me look at another possible team: \\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel (2), Great White (8), Archerfish (0), and Sea Turtle (6). \\\\n\\\\nThis gives good tankiness with Eel, healing with Turtle, and strong AoE and finishing moves. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, let's see the damage potential. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, perhaps the best is [0,2,5,8]. \\\\n\\\\nI think I'll go with that combination. So indices 0,2,5,8. \\\\n\\\\nWait, let me double-check:\\\\n\\\\nArcherfish (0): AoE active and passive.\\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel (2): Damage mitigation and ATK gain, AoE.\\\\n\\\\nManta Ray (5): Can protect a teammate with damage reduction and +ATK.\\\\n\\\\nGreat White (8): Strong on low HP enemies.\\\\n\\\\nYes, that seems solid. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe replace Manta with Sea Wolf (4) for critical hits. \\\\n\\\\nHmm, maybe that's better. \\\\n\\\\nBut perhaps Manta's support is better for keeping the team alive. \\\\n\\\\nOkay, I'll decide on [0,2,5,8].\\\\n</think>\\\\n\\\\nThe selected team combines area damage, support, and strong finishing moves. Here's the breakdown:\\\\n\\\\n**Team Composition**:\\\\n1. **Archerfish (0)**: Provides area-of-effect (AoE) damage with its active, helping to weaken all enemies simultaneously.  \\\\n2. **Electric Eel (2)**: Mitigates incoming damage and boosts ATK over time, making its AoE attacks increasingly potent.  \\\\n3. **Manta Ray (5)**: Enhances a teammate\\\\u2019s survivability with damage reduction and boosts their ATK, supporting frontline fighters.  \\\\n4. **Great White Shark (8)**: Deals heavy damage to weakened enemies, excelling at finishing off low-HP targets.  \\\\n\\\\n**Synergy**:  \\\\n- **Electric Eel** and **Archerfish** work together for sustained AoE damage, with Eel\\\\u2019s increasing ATK amplifying their impact.  \\\\n- **Manta Ray** ensures key team members stay alive and deal more damage.  \\\\n- **Great White** capitalizes on weakened enemies to secure kills efficiently.  \\\\n\\\\nThis team balances offense, defense, and utility without relying on Mimic Fish, keeping selection straightforward while maintaining flexibility and power.  \\\\n\\\\n**Indices**:  \\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"indices\\\\\\\": [0, 2, 5, 8],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"mimic_choice\\\\\\\": null\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\",\\n  \\\"response_metadata\\\": {\\n    \\\"model\\\": \\\"qwq:32b\\\",\\n    \\\"created_at\\\": \\\"2025-08-15T18:08:29.734867278Z\\\",\\n    \\\"done\\\": true,\\n    \\\"done_reason\\\": \\\"stop\\\",\\n    \\\"total_duration\\\": 93392539195,\\n    \\\"load_duration\\\": 46220142,\\n    \\\"prompt_eval_count\\\": 2098,\\n    \\\"prompt_eval_duration\\\": 1991529292,\\n    \\\"eval_count\\\": 2628,\\n    \\\"eval_duration\\\": 91344738098,\\n    \\\"model_name\\\": \\\"qwq:32b\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"tool_calls\\\": [],\\n  \\\"raw_response_type\\\": \\\"<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>\\\",\\n  \\\"additional_attrs\\\": {\\n    \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": \\\"{}\\\",\\n    \\\"construct\\\": \\\"<bound method BaseModel.construct of <class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>>\\\",\\n    \\\"copy\\\": \\\"<bound method BaseModel.copy of AIMessage(content='<think>\\\\\\\\nOkay, I need to select a team of four fish for the first round.

The user mentioned that in the previous attempt, there was no tool call made, so I need to make sure to use the select_team_tool correctly this time. Let me think through the options.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, looking at the roster provided, there are 12 fish. The key is to pick four with good synergies. The user recommended avoiding Mimic Fish for simplicity, so maybe I should avoid index 11 unless necessary. Let me check each fish's abilities again.\\\\n\\\\nArcherfish (0) has an active that attacks all enemies for 35% ATK. Pufferfish (1) can boost ATK by sacrificing HP. Electric Eel (2) and Sunfish (3) have similar passives but their active skills differ. Sunfish's active is similar to Pufferfish's, so maybe they aren't the best together. \\\\n\\\\nSea Wolf (4) has a critical attack active, Manta Ray (5) can give damage reduction and ATK boost. Sea Turtle (6) has shields and a healing active with critical damage on first uses. Octopus (7) also gives damage reduction. Great White Shark (8) and Hammerhead (9) have strong attacks based on target HP. Clownfish (10) can share damage and has an AoE active. \\\\n\\\\nI need a balanced team. Maybe a mix of defense, offense, and support. Let's consider:\\\\n\\\\n1. Archerfish (0) for area damage.\\\\n2. Sea Turtle (6) for shields and healing.\\\\n3. Great White Shark (8) for strong attacks on low HP targets.\\\\n4. Manta Ray (5) for damage reduction and ATK boost.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe Electric Eel (2) for sustained ATK gains? Or Octopus (7) for support. Let me see the synergy. Archerfish's AoE can help with clearing, Sea Turtle's shields protect, Great White can finish off low HP enemies, and Manta Ray's damage reduction and ATK boost can make attacks more effective. That seems solid. \\\\n\\\\nWait, the user said to avoid Mimic Fish unless needed, so I won't include index 11. Let me confirm the indices: 0 (Archerfish), 5 (Manta Ray), 6 (Sea Turtle), 8 (Great White Shark). That's four. Let me check if there's any overlap or better combos. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe replace Great White with Hammerhead for explosion when killed, but Great White's active is more consistent. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, Clownfish (10) could share damage and have AoE. Hmm. But maybe the initial selection is okay. \\\\n\\\\nSo the team indices would be [0,5,6,8]. Let me make sure that's four distinct indices. Yes. And since there's no Mimic Fish, the mimic_choice is not needed. Therefore, the correct function call would be select_team_tool with fish_indices [0,5,6,8]. \\\\n\\\\nI need to format this properly as a JSON tool call within the XML tags. Let me ensure no typos. The parameters should be fish_indices as an array of integers, and since no Mimic is used, omit mimic_choice. The function is select_team_tool.\\\\n</think>\\\\n\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"response_metadata\\\": {\\n    \\\"model\\\": \\\"qwq:32b\\\",\\n    \\\"created_at\\\": \\\"2025-08-15T18:08:56.473570756Z\\\",\\n    \\\"done\\\": true,\\n    \\\"done_reason\\\": \\\"stop\\\",\\n    \\\"total_duration\\\": 26211520752,\\n    \\\"load_duration\\\": 48561574,\\n    \\\"prompt_eval_count\\\": 2128,\\n    \\\"prompt_eval_duration\\\": 2057079782,\\n    \\\"eval_count\\\": 712,\\n    \\\"eval_duration\\\": 24095904260,\\n    \\\"model_name\\\": \\\"qwq:32b\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"tool_calls\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"{'name': 'select_team_tool', 'args': {'fish_indices': [0, 5, 6, 8]}, 'id': 'cd8958f8-dba8-40b4-a999-3f31e989e3d0', 'type': 'tool_call'}\\\",\\n      \\\"args\\\": {},\\n      \\\"id\\\": null,\\n      \\\"raw\\\": \\\"{'name': 'select_team_tool', 'args': {'fish_indices': [0, 5, 6, 8]}, 'id': 'cd8958f8-dba8-40b4-a999-3f31e989e3d0', 'type': 'tool_call'}\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"raw_response_type\\\": \\\"<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>\\\",\\n  \\\"additional_attrs\\\": {\\n    \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": \\\"{}\\\",\\n    \\\"construct\\\": \\\"<bound method BaseModel.construct of <class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>>\\\",\\n    \\\"copy\\\": \\\"<bound method BaseModel.copy of AIMessage(content=\\\\\\\"<think>\\\\\\\\nOkay, I need to select a team of four fish for the Aquawar tournament.

My team has four fish: Archerfish, Electric Eel, Manta Ray, and Sea Turtle. All are at full HP and ATK since it's early in the game. The enemy team is all hidden, so I don't know their compositions yet.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I should think about the current phase. Since it's the action phase, I can either attack normally or use an active skill. The goal here is probably to gather information or start weakening the enemy. But since the enemy is all hidden, maybe using active skills that can deal area damage or provide buffs could be useful.\\\\n\\\\nLooking at my fish's abilities:\\\\n\\\\n- Archerfish's active attacks all enemies for 35% ATK. Since they start with 100 ATK, that would be 35 damage each. So against four enemies, that's 35 each, totaling 140 damage spread out. But since they are hidden, maybe it's better to hit all of them to reduce their HP a bit.\\\\n\\\\n- Electric Eel's active also hits all enemies for 35% ATK, same as Archerfish. So similar effect.\\\\n\\\\n- Manta Ray's active gives a teammate 70% damage reduction on next attack and +20 ATK. This could be good for setting up a stronger attack later.\\\\n\\\\n- Sea Turtle's active gives a teammate a heal of 20 HP (next damage?), but also, the first three uses deal 120 critical damage. Wait, the description says \\\\\\\"FIRST 3 USES ONLY also deal 120 critical damage\\\\\\\". Hmm, so using Sea Turtle's active might have a big initial effect. But I need to check the exact wording. The active is \\\\\\\"Give teammate heal 20 HP (next damage), FIRST 3 USES ONLY also deal 120 critical damage\\\\\\\". So when you use Sea Turtle's active, you can target a teammate, and on their next damage (maybe when they take damage?), they get healed? Not sure. But the first three uses also deal 120 critical damage. Maybe the active itself deals 120 damage to an enemy? That might make more sense. The description is a bit unclear, but perhaps the first three times you use Sea Turtle's active, it also attacks an enemy for 120 crit damage. Alternatively, maybe the heal is a shield or something. Hmm, maybe I should prioritize using the active skills that deal damage first to hit the enemies.\\\\n\\\\nSince all enemies are hidden, using area attacks like Archerfish or Electric Eel's active could help reduce their HP and maybe trigger some hidden reveals if they have certain passives. But since they are hidden, only an assertion can reveal them. However, since it's early, maybe it's better to spread damage to see if any of them have passives that react, but I don't know their types yet.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, using Sea Turtle's active if it can deal damage might be better. Let me think again. The Sea Turtle's active says \\\\\\\"FIRST 3 USES ONLY also deal 120 critical damage when giving teammate heal 20 HP (next damage)\\\\\\\". Maybe the active's main effect is to heal a teammate when they take damage, but the first three uses also let you deal 120 crit damage to an enemy? That would make sense. So if I choose to use Sea Turtle's active on a target, perhaps I can deal 120 damage to an enemy. That would be a strong move. Let's assume that. So using Sea Turtle's active on an enemy could be a good start. But wait, the active might require a target. Let me check the parameters for active_skill_tool: the target_index is optional. So maybe Sea Turtle's active can be used without a target, but to deal the 120 damage, maybe a target is required. The description says \\\\\\\"attack lowest HP enemy for 120% ATK\\\\\\\" for Great White Shark, but Sea Turtle's is different. Hmm, perhaps the Sea Turtle's active, when used with a target, deals 120 damage. Since it's the first use, it could be a good option.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, using Manta Ray's active to give a teammate damage resistance and boost their ATK might set up a strong attack later. But in the current turn, maybe dealing damage is better.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, using Archerfish's active to attack all enemies with 35 each. That's 35 per enemy, so each takes 35 damage. Since they start at 400, that's down to 365 each. Not a huge impact, but spreads damage. Similarly, Electric Eel's active does the same.\\\\n\\\\nComparing options:\\\\n\\\\n- Archerfish or Electric Eel: spread 35 damage each, total 140 over four enemies.\\\\n\\\\n- Sea Turtle's active (if it can deal 120 damage): that's a lot more focused. If I can target the lowest HP, but since they're all at 400, maybe target any, dealing 120. That would reduce one enemy to 280. That's better for focusing down a target.\\\\n\\\\n- Manta Ray's active gives a teammate 70% damage reduction next attack and +20 ATK. If I use that on, say, Manta Ray itself, then next attack they do would have higher damage and take less damage.\\\\n\\\\nHmm. Since it's turn 2, maybe using Sea Turtle's active to get that 120 damage is better. Let me proceed under that assumption. So if I activate Sea Turtle (index 3) and maybe target an enemy? The parameters for active_skill_tool require fish_index and optionally target_index. For Sea Turtle's active, maybe the target is the enemy to deal the 120 damage. Let's suppose the active's first use allows me to choose a target to hit with 120. So using active_skill_tool on Sea Turtle (index 3) with target_index 0 (first enemy). That would deal 120 damage to enemy 0, bringing their HP to 280.\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, if the target is a teammate, then the heal applies but the 120 is a separate effect. The description says \\\\\\\"give teammate heal 20 HP (next damage), FIRST 3 USES ONLY also deal 120 critical damage\\\\\\\". Maybe the \\\\\\\"also\\\\\\\" part is an additional effect regardless of the target. So when you use Sea Turtle's active on a teammate, it both gives them a heal effect and deals 120 damage to an enemy. The enemy could be the lowest HP or chosen? The wording is unclear. Maybe the 120 is a flat damage to an enemy. Since it's the first use, I'll assume that using Sea Turtle's active on any target (maybe the enemy) would let me deal 120. Alternatively, maybe the active doesn't require targeting an enemy, just a teammate. For example, using the active on a teammate would give them the 20 HP heal on next damage, and also deal 120 damage to an enemy. Since it's the first use, the 120 is applied. So perhaps the target_index here is the teammate to apply the buff, and the 120 is a separate attack. For example, using active_skill on Sea Turtle (index 3) with target_index 1 (Electric Eel), then the active would give Electric Eel the damage reduction and maybe the 120 is dealt to an enemy. This is a bit confusing, but given the description, I think the first three uses of Sea Turtle's active also deal 120 critical damage when used. So maybe the active's main effect is the heal/shield, but the 120 is a bonus. To maximize damage, I should use Sea Turtle's active to deal that 120 to an enemy. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe the 120 is automatically applied to the lowest HP enemy. Let's proceed with that. The most impactful move here would be using Sea Turtle's active to deal 120 damage to an enemy. So I'll choose to use Sea Turtle's active, target the first enemy (index 0). \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, if Sea Turtle's active can only be used on a teammate, then maybe I should target one of my own. Let me check the active description again. \\\\\\\"Give teammate heal 20 HP (next damage), FIRST 3 USES ONLY also deal 120 critical damage\\\\\\\". So the active is targeting a teammate to give them the heal effect, and the \\\\\\\"also deal\\\\\\\" part is an additional effect. Therefore, when you use Sea Turtle's active on a teammate (like index 0 or 1), it gives them the heal, and also deals 120 damage to an enemy (maybe the lowest HP or a random one). Assuming the 120 is dealt to an enemy, this could be effective. \\\\n\\\\nIn that case, using Sea Turtle (index 3) to target, say, Manta Ray (index 2), gives Manta Ray the damage reduction and the 120 is dealt to an enemy. That way, the 120 is a free hit. That's a good move. So the parameters would be fish_index 3 (Sea Turtle), target_index 2 (Manta Ray). The 120 damage would hit an enemy, perhaps the first one. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe the target is optional. Let me see the function parameters again. active_skill_tool requires fish_index, and target_index is optional. So maybe if I don't specify target_index, it defaults to not targeting, but I need to check the description. The Sea Turtle's active says \\\\\\\"Give teammate heal...\\\\\\\", so it must target a teammate. Therefore, target_index must be one of my own fish. \\\\n\\\\nAssuming that the 120 damage is applied to an enemy regardless, then choosing to use Sea Turtle's active on a teammate would be the way. Let's go with that. So using Sea Turtle's active on, say, Manta Ray (index 2). Then, the 120 damage is dealt to an enemy, possibly the first one. That way, the enemy's HP drops by 120. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, if the 120 is a separate attack choice, but since it's the active's first use, I can choose the target. Maybe the description implies that when using the active, the first three times, you can attack an enemy for 120. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, perhaps the active's first three uses allow the Sea Turtle to deal 120 crit damage in addition to the main effect. \\\\n\\\\nGiven the uncertainty, but wanting to maximize damage, I'll proceed with using Sea Turtle's active to deal 120 damage to an enemy. To do that, the target_index would be the enemy, but since the active is supposed to target a teammate, maybe the 120 is automatically applied. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe I should use Archerfish's area attack to hit all enemies. That's 35 each, which is 140 total. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, using Manta Ray's active to buff a teammate for future attacks. \\\\n\\\\nHmm. Another angle: since the enemies are hidden, we can't target specific ones, so area attacks might be better. \\\\n\\\\nArcherfish's active: 35 per enemy, spreading damage. \\\\n\\\\nElectric Eel's same. \\\\n\\\\nSo using either of those could be good. Since both have the same effect, it might not matter which. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, using Sea Turtle's active for the 120, even if it's on a specific enemy, even if hidden, but since all are at 400, targeting any is fine. \\\\n\\\\nGiven the uncertainty in Sea Turtle's ability, maybe the safer choice is to use Archerfish's active to attack all enemies. Let's go with that. \\\\n\\\\nSo using Archerfish (index 0) active, which hits all enemies for 35 each. \\\\n\\\\nSo the parameters would be fish_index 0, target_index is not needed (since it's an area effect). \\\\n\\\\nTherefore, the active_skill_tool call would be with fish_index 0. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, if the target is required to be none. \\\\n\\\\nWait, the function parameters: active_skill_tool takes fish_index and optionally target_index. Since Archerfish's active is an area attack, target_index might not be needed. \\\\n\\\\nThus, the correct move is to use Archerfish's active to deal 35 damage to all four enemies, lowering their HP to 365 each. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe the active only hits three enemies? The description says \\\\\\\"all enemies\\\\\\\". If there are four enemies (assuming the user is in a scenario with four enemies?), but the problem statement doesn't specify. Maybe it's a standard battle with four? \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe the enemies are the opponent's team, but the initial prompt doesn't specify. Assuming the user is in a situation where all four enemies are present, then the area attack would spread the damage. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, if the enemies are only the ones in the scenario, maybe two? The problem is unclear, but given that each active hits all enemies, I'll proceed. \\\\n\\\\nGiven that, using Archerfish's active is a good move. \\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, maybe using Electric Eel's active as well. But either is fine. \\\\n\\\\nI think I'll choose to use Archerfish's active to hit all enemies. \\\\n\\\\nSo the final answer would be to use the active skill of Archerfish (index 0) with no target, resulting in 35 damage to each enemy.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"response_metadata\\\": {\\n    \\\"model\\\": \\\"qwq:32b\\\",\\n    \\\"created_at\\\": \\\"2025-08-15T18:10:51.935297104Z\\\",\\n    \\\"done\\\": true,\\n    \\\"done_reason\\\": \\\"stop\\\",\\n    \\\"total_duration\\\": 100213883381,\\n    \\\"load_duration\\\": 39799041,\\n    \\\"prompt_eval_count\\\": 1960,\\n    \\\"prompt_eval_duration\\\": 161553155,\\n    \\\"eval_count\\\": 2874,\\n    \\\"eval_duration\\\": 100002982663,\\n    \\\"model_name\\\": \\\"qwq:32b\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"tool_calls\\\": [],\\n  \\\"raw_response_type\\\": \\\"<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>\\\",\\n  \\\"additional_attrs\\\": {\\n    \\\"additional_kwargs\\\": \\\"{}\\\",\\n    \\\"construct\\\": \\\"<bound method BaseModel.construct of <class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>>\\\",\\n    \\\"copy\\\": \\\"<bound method BaseModel.copy of AIMessage(content='<think>\\\\\\\\nOkay, let\\\\\\\\'s see.
